## Quick start

### Dependency
Some package dependencies need to be installed before compiling.

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install wget git python libc6-i386 
```


### Compile

The compile project is in the apps directory, you can quickly compile, burn, and run the process through `template_demo`. Use the following command in the root directory to compile: 
``` bash
$ sh build_app.sh apps/template_demo template_demo 1.0.0
```
apps/template_demo: compile project path

template_demo: compile project name

1.0.0: The version of the current compilation firmware

### Compilation cleanup

You can clear the compiled intermediate files with the following commands:

``` bash
$ sh build_app.sh apps/template_demo template_demo 1.0.0 clean
```

### Burning authorization
